# AI Role Selector

A simple web application that simulates AI personas for different professional roles. Users can select a role and interact with an AI that responds based on that professional context.

## Features

- Multiple professional role options (Developer, Designer, Data Scientist, etc.)
- Interactive chat interface
- Role-specific responses
- Mobile-responsive design
- Works with GitHub Pages

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings > Pages)
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Your site will be published at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Customization

### Adding New Roles

To add new professional roles, edit the `roles.js` file and add a new object to the `roles` array following this structure:

```javascript
{
    id: 'uniqueId',
    name: 'Role Name',
    icon: 'fa-icon-name',  // Font Awesome icon class
    description: 'Brief description of the role',
    greeting: "Initial greeting message from the AI",
    knowledge: [
        "Knowledge area 1",
        "Knowledge area 2",
        // Add more knowledge areas
    ]
}
```

### Improving AI Responses

For a more sophisticated AI experience, you could:

1. Replace the `generateResponse()` function in `script.js` with calls to an actual AI API
2. Add more conditional responses in the existing function
3. Implement a more advanced response generation system

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Font Awesome for icons
